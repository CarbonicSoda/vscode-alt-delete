# Features
Have you ever found the Ctrl-Backspace shortcut and its similar counterparts to be inflexible or cumbersome to use?  

*Alt-Delete* comes to rescue!  

Alt-Delete provides keymaps of:
- **Ctrl-Backspace** → **Alt-Backspace**
- **Ctrl-Delete** → **Alt-Delete**
- (shift+) **Ctrl-LeftArrow** → (shift+) **Alt-[< / -]**
- (shift+) **Ctrl-RightArrow** → (shift+) **Alt-[> / +]**

>*Keymaps are also supported with multiple selections.*

Unlike their Ctrl cousins, Alt-Keys will stop at **CAPITAL** characters:  
*eg.* with Ctrl-Backspace, **camelCase** would be wiped out.  
but with Alt-Backspace, **camelCase** would become **camel**.
