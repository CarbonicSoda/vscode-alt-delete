### UPDATE
**Now supports multiple selections!**  
**Now supported on vscode.dev!**

# FEATURES

Frustrated with using unflexible Ctrl-Keys?  
**Alt-Delete** comes to rescue!  
Alt-Delete provides keymaps to counterparts of...  
**Ctrl+**[**Backspace**, **Delete**, (shift+) **LeftArrow**, (shift+) **RightArrow**]

- **Ctrl+Backspace** → **Alt+Backspace**
- **Ctrl+Delete** → **Alt+Delete**
- (shift+) **Ctrl+LeftArrow** → (shift+) **Alt+[< / -]**
- (shift+) **Ctrl+RightArrow** → (shift+) **Alt+[> / +]**

Unlike their Ctrl cousins, Alt-Keys will stop at **CAPITAL** characters:  
*eg.* with Ctrl-Backspace, **camelCase** would be wiped out  
but with Alt-Backspace, **camelCase** would become **camel**
