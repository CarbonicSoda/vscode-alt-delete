	Alt-Delete for VSCode
</h3>
<h4 align="center">Keymaps of Ctrl-Del Cousins for Your Ease</h4>

## Features

Ever found the Ctrl-Backspace shortcut and its similar counterparts to be inflexible or cumbersome to use?

Alt-Delete comes to rescue!

Alt-Delete provides keymaps of:

-   **Ctrl-Backspace** → **Alt-Backspace**
-   **Ctrl-Delete** → **Alt-Delete**
-   (shift+) **Ctrl-LeftArrow** → (shift+) **Alt-[< / -]**
-   (shift+) **Ctrl-RightArrow** → (shift+) **Alt-[> / +]**

> Keymaps are also supported with multiple selections.

Unlike their Ctrl cousins, Alt-Keys will stop at **CAPITAL** characters:  
_eg._ with Ctrl-Backspace, **camelCase** would be wiped out.  
but with Alt-Backspace, **camelCase** would become **camel**.
