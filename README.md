# FEATURES

Frustrated using unflexible Ctrl-Keys? **Alt-Delete** comes to rescue!  
Alt-Delete provides keymaps to counterparts of **Ctrl-** [**Backspace**, **Delete**, (shift+)**LeftArrow**, (shift+)**RightArrow**]

- **Ctrl-Backspace** --> **Alt-Backspace**
- **Ctrl-Delete** --> **Alt-Delete**
- **Ctrl-(Shift)-LeftArrow** --> **Alt-(Shift)--** (minus sign)
- **Ctrl-(Shift)-RightArrow** --> **Alt-(Shift)-+** (equal/plus sign)

Unlike their Ctrl cousins, Alt-Keys will stop at **CAPITAL** characters:  
eg. with Ctrl-Backspace, **camelCase** would be wiped out  
 with Alt-Backspace, **camelCase** would become **camel**

And **MUCH** more!
